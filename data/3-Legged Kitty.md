# 3 Legged Kitty - Complete Rules Guide

**3 Legged Kitty** is a 3-player trick-taking card game that combines bidding, a little bluffing, and strategy. Each round, one player (called "**the Cat**") plays alone against the other two players who work together.

The unique bidding system uses cards from your hand as currency, creating tough decisions from the very start!

## What You'll Need

- **A standard deck**: A deck of 52 standard playing cards
- **Paper and pencil** for keeping score
- **3 players** (exactly - this game is designed specifically for three)

## Game Overview

Each hand consists of three main phases:

1. **Bidding Phase** - Players bid for the right to be "the Cat" by offering cards from their hand
2. **Card Exchange Phase** - Players rebuild their hands using the bid cards
3. **Play Phase** - Play 10 tricks with the Cat trying to make their contract

## Initial Setup

1. Shuffle the cards, and deal 10 to each player
2. Set aside the rest, face down. They will not be played with this round

## Phase 1: The Bidding Phase

### How Bidding Works Mechanically

**The key concept**: During bidding, you place cards from your hand face up in front of you. **These cards serve only as payment for your bid - their suit and value don't matter for bidding purposes!** You're essentially "spending" cards from your hand to bid.

**Basic bidding process**:

1. **Starting player**: The player to the dealer's left makes the first bid

2. **Making a bid**:

   - Place at least one card from your hand **FACE UP** in front of you
   - Announce your bid (a number and a type, like "2 Hearts")
   - These cards stay visible in front of you during the entire bidding phase

3. **Raising the bid**:

   - Each new bid must be higher than the previous bid
   - If your bid number is the same or just one higher than the previous bid, place 1 card
   - If your bid number jumps by more than one, place additional cards (one extra card for each number you skip)
   - Example: Going from "3 Clubs" to "5 Spades" requires placing 2 cards

4. **Passing**: You may pass instead of bidding, but once you pass, you cannot re-enter the bidding

5. **Bidding ends**: When two players pass consecutively after someone's bid

### Understanding What You're Bidding

Bids represent contracts - promises about how many tricks you'll take (or won't take) during play. Each bid consists of:

- **A number** (1 through 10)
- **A type** (Null, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, or No Trump)

There are six types of bids:

**1. Null X** (where X is 1-8) - You promise to take NO MORE than (8-X) tricks

- Null 1 = take 7 or fewer tricks
- Null 3 = take 5 or fewer tricks
- Null 6 = take 2 or fewer tricks
- Null 8 = take 0 tricks (can't win any tricks!)

_Note: Null only goes up to 8. Null 9 and 10 don't exist since you can't take negative tricks._

**2. X Clubs** - Clubs are trump, you promise to take AT LEAST X tricks

**3. X Diamonds** - Diamonds are trump, you promise to take AT LEAST X tricks

**4. X Hearts** - Hearts are trump, you promise to take AT LEAST X tricks

**5. X Spades** - Spades are trump, you promise to take AT LEAST X tricks

**6. X No Trump** - No trump suit, you promise to take AT LEAST X tricks

### Bid Hierarchy

Bids are ranked first by **NUMBER**, then by **TYPE** within that number:

- All 1-bids < All 2-bids < All 3-bids < ... < All 10-bids

Within each number, the ranking is:

- **Null** < **Clubs** < **Diamonds** < **Hearts** < **Spades** < **No Trump**

**Examples:**

- "1 No Trump" beats "1 Spades" (same number, no trump ranks higher)
- "2 Null" beats "1 No Trump" (2 beats 1, regardless of type)
- "5 Spades" beats "5 Hearts" (same number, spades rank higher)
- "7 Clubs" beats "6 No Trump" (7 beats 6, regardless of type)

### Complete Bidding Example

Let's follow a full bidding round to see how the card placement works:

1. **Alice** (first to bid): Places 1 card face up, announces "1 Club"
2. **Bob**: Places 1 card face up, announces "1 Heart" _(same number, but hearts beat clubs)_
3. **Carol**: Places 1 card face up, announces "2 No Trump"
4. **Alice**: Places 1 card face up, announces "3 Null"
5. **Bob**: Places 2 cards face up, announces "5 Diamonds" _(jumping from 3 to 5 requires 2 cards)_
6. **Carol**: Places 1 card face up, announces "5 No Trump"
7. **Alice**: "Pass"
8. **Bob**: "Pass"
9. **Carol**: "Pass"

**Result**: Carol wins with "5 No Trump" and becomes "the Cat". The hand will be played with no trump suit.

**Remember**: The actual cards placed (their suits and values) have no connection to the bids made. A player could place the 2♣ while bidding "7 Spades" - the card is just payment!

### After Bidding Ends

Once someone wins the bid:

1. They become "**the Cat**" for this round
2. **ALL** cards that were bid (from all players) are collected into a central pile called "**the kitty**"
3. _In our example: Alice's 2 cards + Bob's 3 cards + Carol's 3 cards = 8 cards in the kitty_
4. The winning bid determines how the hand will be played:
   - If the winning bid was **null** or **no trump** → the hand is played with no trump suit
   - If the winning bid was a **suit** → that suit is trump for the hand

## Phase 2: Card Exchange

This phase happens in a specific order, giving each player a chance to rebuild their hand to exactly 10 cards.

**1. The Cat** picks up the kitty and adds it to their hand. They select 10 cards to keep, putting the rest back in the center, face up. This becomes **the stray**.

**2. Starting to the Cat's left**, the player chooses cards from the stray to add to their hand to bring it back up to 10. _(Note: they do not add all of them and choose 10—they can only draw enough to reach 10 cards.)_

**3. The last player** adds the remaining cards to their hand, bringing them up to 10.

---

**Example**: Carol (the Cat) had 7 cards left after bidding. She picks up the 8-card kitty, giving her 15 cards total. She keeps her best 10 cards and places 5 cards face up as the stray.

Alice (to Carol's left) has 8 cards remaining. She looks at the 5-card stray and takes 2 cards she likes, leaving 3 cards in the stray.

Finally, Bob takes the last 3 cards, returning his hand to 10 cards.

## Phase 3: Playing the Tricks

### Basic Trick-Taking Rules

**1. The Cat always leads** the first trick

**2. Following suit**:

- You **MUST** play a card of the same suit as the card led if you have one
- If you can't follow suit, you may play any card

**3. Winning tricks**:

- Highest card of the led suit wins **UNLESS...**
- Someone plays a trump card (in trump contracts only)
- Trump cards beat all non-trump cards

**4. Card rankings** (highest to lowest): **A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7**, etc...

**5. Next trick**: Winner of a trick leads the next trick

## Scoring System

### Did the Cat Make Their Contract?

**For Suit/No-Trump Contracts**: The Cat must take **AT LEAST** the number of tricks bid

- Bid "4 Hearts", take 4 tricks = **Success!** ✓
- Bid "4 Hearts", take 5 tricks = **Success!** ✓ _(can take more)_
- Bid "4 Hearts", take 3 tricks = **Failed** ✗

**For Null Contracts**: The Cat must take **NO MORE** than (8 minus bid number) tricks

- Bid "Null 3", allowed maximum is 5 tricks _(8-3=5)_
- Take 5 or fewer = **Success!** ✓
- Take 6 or more = **Failed** ✗

### Points Awarded

- **Cat succeeds**: The Cat scores points equal to their bid number
- **Cat fails**: Each opponent scores 5 points

## Winning the Game

🏆 **First player to reach 30 points wins!**
